The Following Security Checklists are aken care in the coding:
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) Prepare for failure(most places are checked with appropriate modifier to ensure the contract owner and  user address))
2) Automatic Testing is include to indentify any potential bugs before deploying( truffle develop, will compile, migrate and test on local Ganache)
3) Keeping the Contract Simple, IPFS is used to store most of the client information and the contract would just have a minimal information.
4) Tracking the Transaction state variable will not provide significant clue about the Customer luggage details to the attacker,
   -But the DApp either the webbased or mobile based give the complete provenance to the user to track their Luggage.
